# gameoff2022 - SHOTGUN HONEYMOON


You love your shotgun.

You REALLY love your shotgun.

It talks to you, gives you ideas.

After your marriage, you decided to take your beloved on the most romantic place a shotgun can go: a decrepit cemetary.

WASD to move, Mouse to aim and shoot, R to reload and F to talk to your shotgun wife.
