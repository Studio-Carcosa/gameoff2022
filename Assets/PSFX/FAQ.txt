== Polygons/Triangles are disappearing completely when I get close to them! What is going on?
=

This is an intentional optional feature that can be turned off in the PSFXCamera next to "Triangle Near Clipping" under "PSX Depth"

================
== Geometry is disappearing before it reaches my camera's far clipping plane
================

This is another intentional feature that can be negated by setting the "Triangle Culling Distance" to a value at or beyond the far
clipping plame of your camera (Example: if your camera's far plane is set to 1000, you can set this parameter to 1001)

================
== What is the purpose of the Fade slider?
================

Many games for the PS1 implented a fade-to-black fade when transitioning between scenes, areas, and menus. To save on computational
power and instruction storage space, a subtractive fade would be implemented. PSFX has Subtractive Fade selected by default and
Chromatic Cascade fade as as stylized version of the aforementioned fading technique, and a normal linear interpolated fade.

The intention is that this fade will be controlled outside the GUI by a script written by a developer, where the GUI slider serves
as a demonstration of what the fade will look like.

================
== What does Camera Position Precision do?
================

Because of the PS1's limiting hardware, the camera was not excempt from the rounding issues that caused the same wobbling effect for
vertices and geometry. This feature gives the camera a subtle snapping effect to it similar to what Vertex Precision does.

================
== Can the resolution scale be set to higher than 10? / I want to set the Resolution Scale higher than 10
================

This can be accomplished in two ways:

1. Set the value manually using an external script
2. In the PSFXCameraGUI.cs file located in PSFX/Editor, on line 35, you may set the value higher than 10

================
== I want to achieve a more classic lighting effect, how do I do this? / How do I enable vertex lighting?
================

Vertex can be enabled in Unity by setting your light to "Not Important" next to "Render Mode". Note do to a limit with Unity, only 4
vertex lights may be present at a time.

== Nothing here addressed my question/issue
